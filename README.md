1. Designed a class and a method to display info, no trouble.

2. Crafted a function and used this. Here is were trouble starts, dont think we went over this nearly enough, instructor was unable to even use bind in class, and wasnt able to answer questions on bind and used call instead.

3. Designed Class, was able to extend class with Electric car changes.
 
4. Once again lack of understanding on this and arrow functions. Material lacking, all self research here.

I really feel this week has shown me that I dont know what is expected of peoples time at home. I go through the videos, which explains things, but then going through examples and epics, which requires info that was no where in the linked materials. I am feeling a bit of lack of respect for my time. I can go to office hours but that should be to explain or guide topics that I have the info for, not to just get the answer or explain concepts never brought up before.
